\section{Conclusion}
\label{Conclusion}
In this special study, the system is one of the ways that can get the vehicle direction,but this system still has an error as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:errorfromOF}.
Some directions are wrong and made the learning part confuse. Because optical flow needs two frames to calculate velocity, it can not have velocity in every frames. This is a limit of optical flow. Thus, the system needs to use the predictable values from Kalman filter.


\section{Future Works}
This special study implemented an algorithm for getting vehicle direction. This can improve to be a wrong-way driving detection. The suggestion for improving are filter out the error from optical flow and use a powerful algorithm for learning part.
